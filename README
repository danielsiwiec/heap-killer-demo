NOTE: You can open this sample inside an IDE using the https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ native importer] or https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship].

This guide demonstrates how to create a Java application with Gradle using `gradle init`.
You can follow the guide step-by-step to create a new project from scratch or download the complete sample project using the links above.

== What you’ll build

You'll generate a Java application that follows Gradle's conventions.

== What you’ll need

* A text editor or IDE - for example link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA]
* A Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or higher - for example link:https://adoptopenjdk.net/[AdoptOpenJDK]
* The latest https://gradle.org/install[Gradle distribution]


== Create a project folder

Gradle comes with a built-in task, called `init`, that initializes a new Gradle project in an empty folder.
The `init` task uses the (also built-in) `wrapper` task to create a Gradle wrapper script, `gradlew`.

The first step is to create a folder for the new project and change directory into it.

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ mkdir demo
$ cd demo
----

== Run the init task

From inside the new project directory, run the `init` task using the following command in a terminal: `gradle init`.
When prompted, select the `2: application` project type and `3: Java` as implementation language.
Next you can choose the DSL for writing buildscripts -  `1  : Groovy` or `2: Kotlin`.
For the other questions, press enter to use the default values.

The output will look like this:

[listing.terminal.sample-command,user-inputs="2|3|1|||"]
----
$ gradle init

Select type of project to generate:
  1: basic
  2: application
  3: library
  4: Gradle plugin
Enter selection (default: basic) [1..4] 2

Select implementation language:
  1: C++
  2: Groovy
  3: Java
  4: Kotlin
  5: Scala
  6: Swift
Enter selection (default: Java) [1..6] 3

Select build script DSL:
  1: Groovy
  2: Kotlin
Enter selection (default: Groovy) [1..2] 1

Select test framework:
  1: JUnit 4
  2: TestNG
  3: Spock
  4: JUnit Jupiter
Enter selection (default: JUnit 4) [1..4]

Project name (default: demo):
Source package (default: demo):

The `init` task generates the new project with the following structure:

<1> Generated folder for wrapper files
<2> Gradle wrapper start scripts
<3> Settings file to define build name and subprojects
<4> Build script of `app` project
<5> Default Java source folder
<6> Default Java test source folder

You now have the project setup to build a Java application.

== Review the project files

The `settings.gradle(.kts)` file has two interesting lines:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="settings.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="settings.gradle.kts[]"]
====
- `rootProject.name` assigns a name to the build, which overrides the default behavior of naming the build after the directory it's in.
  It's recommended to set a fixed name as the folder might change if the project is shared - e.g. as root of a Git repository.
- `include("app")` defines that the build consists of one subproject called `app` that contains the actual code and build logic.
  More subprojects can be added by additional `include(...)` statements.

Our build contains one subproject called `app` that represents the Java application we are building.
It is configured in the `app/build.gradle(.kts)` file:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="app/build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="app/build.gradle.kts[]"]
====
<1> Apply the application plugin to add support for building a CLI application in Java.
<2> Use Maven Central for resolving dependencies.
<3> Use JUnit Jupiter for testing.
<4> This dependency is used by the application.
<5> Define the main class for the application.

The file `src/main/java/demo/App.java` is shown here:

.Generated src/main/java/demo/App.java
[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}/groovy/app/src/main/java/demo/App.java[]
----

The generated test, `src/test/java/demo/App.java` is shown next:

.Generated src/test/java/demo/AppTest.java
[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}/groovy/app/src/test/java/demo/AppTest.java[]
----

The generated test class has a single _JUnit Jupiter_ test.
The test instantiates the `App` class, invokes a method on it, and checks that it returns the expected value.

== Run the application

Thanks to the `application` plugin, you can run the application directly from the command line.
The `run` task tells Gradle to execute the `main` method in the class assigned to the `mainClass` property.

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ ./gradlew run

> Task :app:run
Hello world!

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
----

NOTE: The first time you run the wrapper script, `gradlew`, there may be a delay while that version of `gradle` is downloaded and stored locally in your `~/.gradle/wrapper/dists` folder.

== Bundle the application

The `application` plugin also bundles the application, with all its dependencies, for you.
The archive will also contain a script to start the application with a single command.

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ ./gradlew build

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 0s
7 actionable tasks: 7 executed
----

If you run a full build as shown above, Gradle will have produced the archive in two formats for you:
`app/build/distributions/app.tar` and `app/build/distributions/app.zip`.

== Publish a Build Scan

The best way to learn more about what your build is doing behind the scenes, is to publish a link:https://scans.gradle.com[build scan].
To do so, just run Gradle with the `--scan` flag.

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ ./gradlew build --scan
